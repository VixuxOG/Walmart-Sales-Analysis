# Jar Business Analyst Intern Assignment round

- Sharing this assignment without my analysis document solution so my peers can take it as a challenge and practice.  
- Unfortunately, I received this assignment during Diwali week while I was traveling and on a break. By the time I checked my inbox, the deadline had already passed. Surprisingly, I didnâ€™t receive any prior call from anyone at Jar before being given this assignment for the hiring round. I had applied for this role about six months ago.
